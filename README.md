# glow-fur-pro-mini
Adafruit Glow Fur for Arduino Pro Mini

I adapted the code from Adafruit with additional routines for the Pro Mini, which has a lot more space and room to play with.

I added/integrated the FastLED demo's Fire2012, Cylon, and some of my own creations.

It still needs a lot of comments and code cleanup.
